# Project: Etch-a-Sketch

## The Odin Project

An interactive etch-a-sketch that lets you draw whatever you want! From the Odin Prject [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

Live preview [here](https://jongithub59.github.io/etch-a-sketch/).

## Features

* A cool, immersive design that mimics the frame of a real etch-a-sketch
* Drag the mouse over the screen to create lines for your art
* Erase what's on the screen with the corresponding button
* Use the size buttons to change the grid size

## Reflection

* Used flexbox to create the inner grid, a very difficult but teaching task
* Learned to use two classes to change the color of squares, and toggle between them with the classList property
* Learned about box shadows to make a more realistic and softer looking design
* Learned what [template literals](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35835362/what-does-dollar-sign-and-curly-braces-mean-in-a-string-in-javascript) are and used them in my script
* Figured out how to use a set grid size as a parameter for a for loop to generate the exact amount of squares needed to make a perfect grid
